<h1>Community support</h1>
<p class="lead">
The GeoServer community utilizes multiple channels of communication. This page should help you find the channel best suited for your needs.
</p>

<a id="mail"></a>
<section>
    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
    Email is the primary form of communication for GeoServer users and developers. Being an 
    open community means that sending email to individual developers is discouraged. Instead
    all email communication should take place on one of the email lists. If you have a question
    are chances are someone else has the same question.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are not in position to communicate in public please contact one of our <a href="../support">commercial support</a> vendors.

            This list is for developers to discuss topics related to GeoServer development.
            If you're knee deep in the code it's the place to email. Traffic can be high, as 
            we try to make most all conversations public so people know what's going on.

    <h2>IRC</h2>
    <p>
        Some GeoServer developers still hang out in the #geoserver channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. This can
        be a place to ask questions and talk directly to developers. However it is not
        intended to be a live question and answer session. Users are expected to do their 
        research before hand and ask educated questions.

    <h2>Skype</h2>
    <p>
        The most active of GeoServer developers attend a 1 hour bi-weekly Skype call. This 
        call is primarily for project steering committee to discuss day to day project 
        management issues but all developers who are actively engaged in GeoServer 
        development are welcome. If you wish to attend contact the developer list.

        This is a suitable venue for responsible disclosure of security issues.
