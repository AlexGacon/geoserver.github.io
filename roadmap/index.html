<h1>Release Schedule</h1>
<section>
<p>
GeoServer releases on a six month cycle providing short turn around time for new features.
</p>
<p>
Each GeoServer release is supported with bug fixes for a year, with releases made approximately every two months. This allows for an overlap between supported releases allowing organisations a chance to migrate without undue pressure.

If your organisation is making use of a GeoServer version that is no longer in use by the community all is not lost. You can volunteer on the developer list to make additional releases.
</p>
<p>
Please see the wiki <a href="{{ site.wiki_url }}/Release-Schedule">GeoTools and GeoServer release schedule </a> for specific versions, or to volunteer to help make a release.
